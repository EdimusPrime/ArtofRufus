Alt-H2 Art of Rufus
###GA-FEWD Final Project
---

In this project, I created a personal website for my Artwork. This was to esstentially kill two birds with one stone, as I needed a website to display my artwork as well as a focused goal for my final project in my General Assembly class.

The basic layout of the site was easy to create and finalize as of this moment (further revisions are expected of course). The JavaScript being the biggest challenge along the way. Creating the image carousel provided the biggest hurddle so far. This was due to my struggles to find examples of what I wanted to do, then finding code that I could understand at this point in my journey to learn these coding languages. 

Unfortunately in my rush to create the initial build, I did not approach the coding of my site with a responsive mindset. This edit shall be the focus prior to the project's final due date. Due to the challenge of this change, I have learned the hard way to focus on the responsiveness first and allow the full site to build a bit more naturally.
