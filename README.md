## Art of Rufus
### GA-FEWD Final Project
---

For my Final Project with my class at General Assembly I was determined to create a personal website for my Artwork. The intention of this was two fold- First to establish a strong demonstration of my understanding of all topics covered in class: 

* Structure, design, and style with HTML and CSS
* Use JavaScript and jQuery to make site interactive
* Combine technical and design skills to create a responsive website
* Apply course knowledge by building a website from scratch
* Use your creativity

Second intention was to finally move towards having a solid website to properly display my artwork.

The basic layout of the site was easy to create and finalize (further revisions are expected of course). The JavaScript being the biggest challenge along the way. Creating the image carousel provided the biggest hurddle so far. 

Unfortunately in my rush to create the initial build, I did not approach the coding of my site with a responsive mindset. This edit shall be the focus prior to the project's final due date. Due to the challenge of this change, I have learned the hard way to focus on the responsiveness first and allow the full site to build a bit more naturally. 

#### Update

I successfully updated plenty of code to adapt to Bootstrap framework, while also tweaking a few pages to streamline my content much better.

## Getting Started

Download the files and open starting with index.html. All pages are separated out into their own folder(s). Joint CSS and JS folders

### Prerequisites

Google Chrome-Page was built with a focus in mind. 

Some tests were done in Safari and Firefox, but nothing extensive.
